###Components

#####Smarter familiars
- Allow familiars to pick up loot for you (move chosen items from the floor and chests to your inventory).
- Have them jump in the the pack when there's danger or they're injured. Very useful in later stages.

######Note
- This component has an issue: familiars will pick up items from closed or trapped chests. It's a limitation of the engine that I didn't find a workaround for.
- The less they're told to pick up, the faster they'll do that. So, try to keep the lists short. For example, don't tell them to pick up bandit scalps in BG2.

#####Faster familiars
Make the familiars move as if they had boots of speed, so they don't lag behind the rest of the team.

#####Fair fights
A few opponents in the game basically cheat, or just have unrealistic stats. Sometimes it's to prevent you from breaking the plot, sometimes not. Anyway, if you know what you're doing - why not? This component will allow you to fight them fair and square. Currently affects:
- Arcanis Gath, the thief that insta-kills you on attacking Renal (now you can fight him, he has a normal sword)
- Borda, the magic merchant cheat in BG1 (100% magic resistance - removed)
- Malchor Harpell, the Drizzt's friend that imprisons the whole party without a chance of escaping (now you can fight him)
- Shandalar, the Ulgoth's Beard archmage (90% all resistances, innocent - removed)

##### No reputation loss on using Slayer form
The Slayer form is virtually unusable by good characters because of the reputation penalty. But usually no one is even alive after seeing it - so why should reputation suffer? Up to you decide.
