- [Mod romance cheats](#mod-romance-cheats)
- [Disable intro movies](#disable-intro-movies)

- [Starting bags](#starting-bags)

#### Less autosaves
Disables autosaves on area transitions. This **only** affects transitions that **don't go through worldmap**.

It saves some time, but on the other hand you should treat your saves more carefully. **You've been warned.**

### More map notes
While map notes are heavily used in BG2, helping navigation, BG1 is sadly lacking in that department. Of course, you can put notes on the map manually, but who wants to do that every playthrough?

**Notes:**
1. Obviously, it contains some spoilers. Don't install if you don't like them.
1. It's work in progress, not every little thing has been mapped out. You can suggest new entries.

### Disable lightning during rain
While it's nice to have a bit of bad weather, and a lighting strike hitting a character has certain flavour to it, it's really annoying when it ends your [Hardcore](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/) playthrough - you can do nothing to prevent it. This allows to disable lighting.

### Mod romance cheats
For original Bioware characters, there's long been a tweak that allows multiple romances. Characters from mods, however, are usually less forgiving. This component allows to multi-romance them as well. Currently included:
- Amber
- Tyris
- Saerileth

**Beware** that if you install this, and then hit **any** bug with such character, you'll likely get no support from the corresponding mod authors, only be ridiculed and chased away instead. **You've been warned.**

### Disable intro movies
Disables BIS logo movie and stuff (not the actual game movies).

### Faster loading times
For Classic Editions users. For historical reasons, most games files are compressed to save disk space. Each loading area would need to be decompressed first, taking some extra time. This made sense back when the games were released. Nowadays, the amount of space an IE game takes is nothing compared to other titles.

The component will decompress the files. Don't expect wonders. Maybe some 10-30% improvement.

### Add BG1 tomes stats bonuses to new BG2 characters
To brand new BG2 charaters, gives the stat bonuses that they were supposed to gain from tomes in BG1. The subcomponents are self-describing:
- Either each stat gets +1
- Or each stat except Wisdom gets +1, Wisdom gets +3

### Starting bags
AKA inventory management painkiller. In both Candlekeep and Irenicus' dungeon, you can find a few bags to start the adventure with. Come on, a gem bag is basically a piece of cloth, how come you have to jump through hoops just to get one?

Where to find the bag:
- In Candlekeep, talk to Thorius - near the cellars.
- In the dungeon, check the painting.

Options:
- [Gem, scroll, potion, ammo (GSPA)](#gem-scroll-potion-ammo-gspa)
- [GSPA + holding](#gspa--holding)
- [GSPA + holding, bottomless](#gspa--holding-bottomless)

#### Gem, scroll, potion, ammo (GSPA)
Provides you with 4 basic bags.

#### GSPA + holding
Same 4 bags, and a bag of holding. OK, this is cheating a little.

#### GSPA + holding, bottomless
Same 5 bags, all bottomless. Now, that's real cheating. But it makes life so much easier...
