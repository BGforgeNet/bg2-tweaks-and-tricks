### Less autosaves

Disables autosaves on area transitions. This only affects transitions that don't go through worldmap.

It saves some time, but on the other hand you should treat your saves more carefully.

A side effect is that it allows enemies to follow you through more area transitions. For example, Kangaxx might follow you to the streets of Athkatla.

**You've been warned.**

### More map notes

While map notes are heavily used in BG2, helping navigation, BG1 is sadly lacking in that department. Of course, you can put notes on the map manually, but who wants to do that every playthrough?

**Notes:**

1. Obviously, it contains some spoilers. Don't install if you don't like them.
1. It's work in progress, not every little thing has been mapped out. You can suggest new entries.

### Disable lightning during rain

While it's nice to have a bit of bad weather, and a lighting strike hitting a character has certain flavour to it, it's really annoying when it ends your [Hardcore](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/) playthrough - you can do nothing to prevent it. This allows to disable lighting.

### Mod romance cheats

For original Bioware characters, there's long been a tweak that allows multiple romances. Characters from mods, however, are usually less forgiving. This component allows to multi-romance them as well as skipping other checks (stats, gender, etc).

Currently includes:

- Amber
- Branwen (BG1NPC)
- Dynaheir (BG1NPC)
- Nalia (Dearnise Romance)
- Tyris
- Saerileth
- Shar-Teel (BG1NPC)

This is maintained on best-effort basis, and likely not comprehensive. If your love interest still turns you away, make reports. It is quite possible that you'll still experience romance breakage, so if you're not prepared to deal with it, don't cheat.

**Beware** that if you install this component, and then hit **any** bug with such character, you'll likely get no support from the corresponding mod authors, only be ridiculed and chased away instead. **You've been warned.**

### Disable intro movies

Disables BIS logo movie and stuff (not the actual game movies).

### Faster loading times

For Classic Editions users. For historical reasons, most games files are compressed to save disk space. Each loading area would need to be decompressed first, taking some extra time. This made sense back when the games were released. Nowadays, the amount of space an IE game takes is nothing compared to other titles.

The component will decompress the files. Don't expect wonders. Maybe some 10-30% improvement.

### Add BG1 tomes stats bonuses to new BG2 characters

To brand new BG2 charaters, gives the stat bonuses that they were supposed to gain from tomes in BG1. The subcomponents are self-describing:

- Either each stat gets +1
- Or each stat except Wisdom gets +1, Wisdom gets +3

### Starting bags

AKA inventory management painkiller. In both Candlekeep and Irenicus' dungeon, you can find a few bags to start the adventure with. Come on, a gem bag is basically a piece of cloth, how come you have to jump through hoops just to get one?

Where to find the bags:

- In Candlekeep, talk to Thorius - near the cellars.
- In the dungeon, check the painting.

Options:

- [Gem, scroll, potion, ammo (GSPA)](#gem-scroll-potion-ammo-gspa)
- [GSPA + holding](#gspa--holding)
- [GSPA + holding, bottomless](#gspa--holding-bottomless)

#### Gem, scroll, potion, ammo (GSPA)

Provides you with 4 basic bags.

#### GSPA + holding

Same 4 bags, and a bag of holding. OK, this is cheating a little.

#### GSPA + holding, bottomless

Same 5 bags, all bottomless. Now, that's real cheating. But it makes life so much easier...

### More mage fencing scrolls in BG1

Adds several scrolls to BG1:

- [Spell Thrust](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Arcane_Spells_List#Spell_Thrust) and [Secret Word](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Arcane_Spells_List#Secret_Word) to Ulgoth's Beard store.
- [Breach](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Arcane_Spells_List#Breach) to Shandalar and Kahrk.

The purpose of this component is to allow SCS users to complete more BG1 content in earlier Chapters, should they so choose.

Original BG1 mages weren't too smart, so lack of protection-stripping spells didn't hurt much. However, SCS boosts the AI (and often levels) considerably, making already hard battles even more annoying if the only tactic you have is to outwait enemy's protections.

Spell Thrust and Secret Word additions don't change much, you could get them by rushing the plot to Baldur's Gate/Sorcerous Sundries.

Breach, however, is normally not available in BG1, and its addition changes the battle dynamics. However, as SCS mages are generously using protections, I think it's a justifiable addition.

Finally, this component adds a few Intelligence-boosting potions to Thalantyr, allowing for more reliable scribing for [Hardcore](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/) characters.
