## Improved Traps

Exploring dungeons can be annoying in IE, especially if it's a familiar one, and you spend a lot of time for Find Traps to tick.

Improved Traps offers multiple components to change trap mechannics.

- [Instant detection](#instant-detection)
- [Increase detection range](#increase-detection-range)
- [Trap reminders](#trap-reminders)
- [Trap intuition](#trap-intuition)
- [Core](#core)
- [Non-disarmable Davaeorn's Battle Horrors](#non-disarmable-davaeorns-battle-horrors)

### Instant detection
All traps will be detected nearly instantly, provided that the detecting character has good enough skill.

### Increase detection range
Increases the range to line of sight.

### Trap reminders
A detected trap will display a float, show its type, or just "Trap", based on selection.

### Trap intuition
Before a trap is "detected" by thief skill, a party member will "sense" it: notice that something's wrong, and possibly take an action based on that.

You can choose to use intuition just out of combat, or in combat too.

Based on intuition, multiple actions may be taken:
- Pause game on all traps, or just ground ones. This is not the same as game option "trap found". Game option pause triggers when a trap is detected. This component adds an extra pause when a party member "suspects" that a trap might be nearby. Before it's detected.
- Toggle Find Traps automatically, provided that the character's class allows it.
- Center on the character, or on location of the supposed trap.
- Play the "trap found" sound.

### Core
Core is required to enable the selected components. Components installed after Core won't work.

### Non-disarmable Davaeorn's Battle Horrors
Davaeorn's Battle Horrors can be avoided by disarming the corresponding traps, which seems a bit silly, likely an oversight on developers part. Now they are undetectable and undisarmable.

This is the only Improved Traps component that does *not* require Core.
