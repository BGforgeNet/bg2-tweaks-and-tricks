## Familiars

Familiars aren't very useful in IE games, especially later stages, and even more so in [Hardcore](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Tales_of_the_Sword_Coast) playthroughs. Most of the time they just sit in the backpack and grant the character an HP boost.

TnT changes that, but not by boosting their stats. Instead, it enables the player to give them various orders, which they will carry out. See below for details.

- [Resilient familiars](#resilient-familiars)

### Smarter familiars
Adds a great deal of customization to familiars behaviour. Now you can:
- Have them jump into the pack when there's danger or they're injured. Very useful at later stages.
- Tell them to pick up loot for you (move chosen items from the floor and containers to your inventory). Yes, they can actually fetch items for you!
- Choose various combat tactics.
- Let them drink various potions.
- Order them to follow automatically.

Compatible with [WTP familiars](http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=23874).

**Notes:**
- The less a familiar is told to pick up, the faster it'll do it. So, try to keep the list short. For example, don't tell it to pick up bandit scalps in BG2.
- Familiars as small creatures can get through where humans cannot. So they will pick up items from closed chests. If you don't like that, don't tell them to pick up items.

### Resilient familiars
Protect familiars from getting critical hits (which are almost always lethal to them).
