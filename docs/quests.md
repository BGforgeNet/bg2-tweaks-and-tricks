- [Save Melicamp](#save-melicamp)

### Bloodless deeds
In BGT, it's not possible to complete _all_ Blood Deeds lines, because one of the necromancers destroys a quest item upon receiving it. This component allows to steal it back and complete all three quests, calming your OCD.

### Improved strongholds
This component mostly improves messengers and messages, making them faster, more reliable and less likely to miss the player, but has some additional QoL changes, too:
- Bard: make money collection notification different from fighter stronghold (useful if you play with multi-stronghold).
- Cleric: notify when it's time to visit the Church.
- Druid: notify when it's time to visit the Grove.
- Fighter: notify when it's time to visit the Keep.
- Mage:
  - Notify when it's time to visit the Sphere.
  - Morul will really create new potions _every_ week, not just when you visit him. (Prepare for getting a hoard after Underdark!)
  - Morul will create a wider variety of potions.
- Ranger: notify when it's time to visit the Cabin.

### Save Melicamp
For [Ironman](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/) players. This component allows you to improve Melicamp's chances of surviving. In original, it's about 50/50. Now you can cast [Aid](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Divine_Spells_List#Aid), [Luck](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Arcane_Spells_List#Luck) and [Death Ward](https://pihwiki.bgforge.net/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Divine_Spells_List#Death_Ward) on him, each one will boost the chance by 10%, to a total of 80%, if all 3 spells are active.
