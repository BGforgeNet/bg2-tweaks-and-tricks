### Stores always buy goods at the same price
Disables depreciation in stores. Makes store buying price constant, regardless of how many items are already in stock. Now, you don't have to pile up equipment before selling to get the max money for it. The price is always the same!

### Close shop steal exploit
Close infinite money "steal-sell-steal" exploit. Options are:

##### Can't steal from fences
You can steal from normal merchants, but can't steal from those who buy stolen items themselves.

##### Can't steal from any shops
Just disable stealing in all shops.

### More ankheg armors by Taerom
It seems silly that Taerom constantly complains how **the business is slow**, yet he will only make you one suite of ankheg plate, and not more, even if you have both money and materials. This component enabled him to make as many as you need.

### Limited stock
Having unlimited of anything in a store looks strange. Even more so then the items are magical - scrolls, potions, etc. This just can't be in FR setting. Thus, the stocks of any "infinite" item in any store is limited to a max of 10.
